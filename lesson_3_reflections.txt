When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when you are not working alone or you are working from a different computer or even if you want to save it in GitHub

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it copies everything and you might not want to.
