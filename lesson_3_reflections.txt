When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when you are not working alone or you are working from a different computer or even if you want to save it in GitHub

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it copies everything and you might not want to.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forking, you make a copy on GitHub from GitHub
You clone to your computer from GibHub 
And you brunch dentro del mismo repositorio cuando quieres tener una rama distinta de trabajo.
